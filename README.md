# Fork Notes

This is a fork of https://github.com/mj1618/serverless-offline-sns/issues. Please see README there for usage.

This fork was created in order to make functional SNS/SQS subscriptions when running locally.

To use instead of default `serverless-offline-sns`, install this package to dev dependencies and replace 'serverless-offline-sns' in plugins section of `serverless.yml` with '@ormu5/serverless-offline-sns'.

Feel free to contribute feedback or pull requests. I don't have much time to maintain this on my own but with support I might be inclined.
